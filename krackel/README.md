# 🔥 KRACKEL - Pattern Hero 🔥

A brutal typing rhythm game that combines Guitar Hero-style gameplay with pattern recognition, featuring an authentic **dark 90s grunge rock** aesthetic straight from the underground scene. Channel your inner rockstar and shred the keyboard!

## 🎮 Game Concept

KRACKEL combines Guitar Hero-style rhythm gameplay with creative pattern typing! Hit falling patterns at the right time in the **HIT ZONE**, or freestyle your own patterns between guided challenges. Perfect timing and creative patterns lead to massive scores!

### Two Game Modes:
- **🎯 Guided Mode:** Type patterns that fall down the highway when they hit the green zone
- **🎨 Freestyle Mode:** Create your own patterns between guided challenges for bonus points

### Example Gameplay:
- See "nana" falling → Type "nana" when it hits the HIT ZONE → **PERFECT! +250 points**
- Between patterns, type "hello" repeatedly → **FREESTYLE BONUS! +120 points**
- Miss a falling pattern → **Combo broken!** 😢
